## Issues

- Whatsapp - or other chrome apps - wont yield notifications until manually clicked by the user, among other issues.
    - Try assigning the windows with weirdo appnames by hand rather than all this junk.
    - Use chrome://apps rather than specific sites, more flexible / non compulsary login
    - Enable notifications in the app?
- Dunst uses the Ctrl+` that i use in vscode and i dont know how to remove it

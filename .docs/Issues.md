## Issues

- Whatsapp - or other chrome apps - wont yield notifications until manually clicked by the user, among other issues.
    - Try assigning the windows with weirdo appnames by hand rather than all this junk.
    - Use chrome://apps rather than specific sites, more flexible / non compulsary login
    - Enable notifications in the app?
- Dunst uses the Ctrl+` that i use in vscode and i dont know how to remove it

- For better ^Z

- Screen timeout while watching video
- Compton issues: 
    - Bad value etc.  -> `sudo usermod -a -G video $USER`
    - The above fix didnt last too long... migrate to picom
